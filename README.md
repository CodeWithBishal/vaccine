# Tech Stack Used:
- ðŸ”¹ BootStrap
- ðŸ”¹ HTML
- ðŸ”¹ CSS
- ðŸ”¹ JavaScript
- ðŸ”¹ PHP

# API Used:
- ðŸ”¹ COWIN Public API

This project allowed me to combine my passion for technology with a sense of responsibility to help others during these challenging times. The Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker utilises the power of COWIN Public API to provide real-time information on vaccination centers and their availability status.

Created My Own captcha using PHP in order to prevent abuse to the Public API{ONLY visible in the latest version of my code & not in the below demo video}.
Utilised Browser Cookies to prevent abuse to the Public API.
